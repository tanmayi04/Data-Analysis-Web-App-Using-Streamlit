#stramlit web app for motor-vehicle collisions.

In this project, I have visualized the data of motor vehicle collisions in New York City. For visualization I have used streamlit and python. Aim of this analysis is to answer several questions like Where are the most people injured in NYC?, How many collisions occur during a given time of day?, Breakdown by minute between 1:00 and 2:00, Top 5 dangerous streets by affected class.
